While this website is mine, and mine alone, I'd be remiss to not acknowledge a few people who helped get it off the ground. I know *very* little about making static sites, and what I do know is largely thanks to others. In making this website, I just wanted something that was easy to stand up and maintain. The following people, in no particular order, helped immensely in that endevour by providing either the tools, tutorials, libraries, or inspiration I needed.

Also, thank you to [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/){target="blank"} for writing the knitr package and creating R Markdown. Making this website became a fun weekend project but only because of these tools and their ease of use.
