Having lived in the Deep South my entire life, I am compiling a list of observations as I attend graduate school in a different part of the country. Some might be obvious but intriguing nonetheless. Your perception of a place can change over time, so I expect that documenting things as I experience will be fun to look back on.

1. Dunkin' Donuts. Everywhere.
2. It's not a bazillion degrees all the time.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(magrittr)

read.delim(file = "data/dly-tavg-normal_USW00003856.txt", sep = " ", skip = 6, header = F) %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() -> hun

read.delim(file = "data/dly-tavg-normal_USW00014735.txt", sep = " ", skip = 6, header = F) %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() -> alb

hun[hun == -8888] <- NA
alb[alb == -8888] <- NA
```
